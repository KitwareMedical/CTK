What is this project ?
----------------------

This project is **NOT** the official CTK repository.

It is a fork of CTK sources hosted at https://github.com/commontk/CTK

It is used as staging area to maintain topics specific to [Slicer Custom Application](https://github.com/KitwareMedical/SlicerCustomAppTemplate#readme) that will eventually be contributed back to the official repository.


What is the branch naming convention ?
--------------------------------------

Each branch is named following the pattern `kitware-custom-app-YYYY-MM-DD-SHA{7}`

where:

* `kitware-custom-app` is the name of the custom application (if it can be publicly disclosed)
* `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date of the last official commit associated with the branch.
* `SHA{7}` are the first seven characters of the last official commit associated with the branch.
